# Real Time Systems
The laboratory assignments which I developed in partnership with Meitar Rizner during the Real Time Systems course at Tel Hai Academic College

In the lab assignments we covered several essential topics in the field of real-time systems.
In this collection, you will find a range of programming examples and code snippets that illustrate the concepts of multi-tasking, semaphores, mutual exclusion, message queues, timing, resources access, and priority inversion.
